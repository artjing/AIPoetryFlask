Pa' Césary Corky
what for the rush and bloody pain
what for the blooming and the rain
what for the quest and odyssey
what for the swimming and the sea, see
there b no shore or beach that anyone
can reach
and breathe, inhale, exhale, and love
all seems to ooze the stress that greed has carved in us
surely our species should be meek
before our motherearth’s volcanoes
storms and huracanes
tornadoes, floods and tremors
and there we b secreting poisons for all leggeds, wingeds,
fish and even trees
what for the rush and bloody pain
we’ll surely die, but then
we dig deeper in our heartmindspiritbody
and nurture glow and warmth
and light and peace and patience
and gladness and gardens
and gather all in oneness
and end the pain and bloody rush
desiring naught
expecting naught
missing naught
simply being being
we truly have no choice…though
we imagine, dream, hope, want
being all that we are we are all that is
and that is all there b
césar and corky
this b my writ to chávez y gonzález
carnales de las sonrisas grandes
de las carcajadas llenas
de murales
de cuadros, ensayos
matadors de pendejadas
terminators of guandajos and juanabees
hermanos, jefes
your “death” is but our “birth”
porque amasteis
entregasteis
y hoy, como siempre,
sois imprescindibles
