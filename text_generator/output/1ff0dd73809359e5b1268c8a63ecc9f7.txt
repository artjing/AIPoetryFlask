Usage
An
assumption,
a
pejorative,
an
honest language,
an
honorable death. In grade school, I refused to
accept
the mayor’s handshake; he smiled at everyone
except
people with names like mine. I was born here.
I didn’t have to
adopt
America, but I
adapted
to it.
You understand: a man must be
averse
to opinions
that have
adverse
impacts on whether he lives
or dies. “Before taking any
advice,
know the language
of those who seek to
advise
you.” Certain words
affected
me. Sand nigger, I was called. Camel jockey.
What was the
effect
? While I
already
muttered
under my breath, I did so even more. I am not
altogether
sure we can
all together
come. Everything
was not
all right.
Everything is not
all right.
Imagine poetry without
allusions
to Shakespeare,
Greek mythology, the Bible; or
allusions
without
the adjectives “fanatical,” “extremist,” “Islamic,”
“right,” “left,” “Christian,” “conservative,” “liberal.”
Language written or translated into a single tongue
gives the
illusion
of tradition.
A lot
of people murder
language—
a lot
fully aware.
Among
all the dead,
choose
between
“us” and “them.”
Among
all the names
for the dead—mother, father, brother, sister,
husband, wife, child, friend, colleague, neighbor,
teacher, student, stranger—choose
between
“citizen” and “terrorist.” And poet?
Immoral,
yes, but never
amoral
? Large
amounts,
the number
between 75 and 90 percent of the estimated
150 million to 1 billion—civilians—killed during wars,
over all of recorded human history.
Anxious
is “worried”
or “apprehensive.” American poetry, Americans.
Young, I learned
anyone
born here could become
President. Older, I can point to
any one
of a hundred
reasons why this is a lie.
Anyway
, I don’t want to be
President, not of a country, or club, not here or there,
not
anywhere.
He said, “I turned the car around
because
it began raining bombs.” There’s no chance of ambiguity—
an
as
here could mean “because” or “when”; it makes
no difference—he saw the sky, felt the ground,
knew what would come next; it matters little
when the heart rate in less than a second jumps from
70 to 200 beats per minute. What they did
to my grandfather was
awful
—its wretchedness,
awe-inspiring; its cruelty, terrible; it was
awfully
hard to forget. Just after 8:46 AM, I wondered
awhile
what would happen next. At 9:03 AM, I knew
there was going to be trouble for a
while
to come.
When in her grief the woman said, “We’re going
to hurt them
bad
,” she meant to say, “We’re going
to hurt them
badly.
” For seventeen days, during
air strikes, my grandfather slept on a cot
beside
a kerosene lamp in the basement of his house.
Besides
a few days worth of pills, and a gallon of water,
he had nothing else to eat or drink. Given these conditions,
none of us were surprised that on the eighteenth day,
he died.
Besides,
he was eighty-two years old.
I can write what I please. I don’t need to ask,
May
I?
Like a song: men with
capital
meet in the
Capitol
in the nation’s
capital.
Any disagreements,
censored
;
those making them—poets, dissenters, activists—
censured.
The aftermath, approximately 655,000
people killed. “The Human Cost of War in Iraq:
A Mortality Study, 2002-2006,” Bloomsburg School
of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore,
Maryland); School of Medicine, Al Mustansiriya University
(Baghdad, Iraq); in cooperation with the Center
for International Studies, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts).
The figure just
cited
—655,000 dead—resulted from
a household survey conducted at actual
sites,
in Iraq,
not the Pentagon, or White House, or a newsroom,
or someone’s imagination. Of
course,
language has been
corrupted. Look, the President, who speaks
coarsely,
says, “We must stay the
course.
” The problem with
“Let your
conscience
be your guide” is you must first
be aware,
conscious
, of the fact that a moral principle
is a subjective thing. I wonder: when one “smokes ’em
out of a hole,” if the person doing the smoking
is
conscious
of his
conscience
at work. Am I fully
conscious
of how I arrived at this? The
continual
dissemination
of similar images and ideas. The
continual
aired footage
of planes striking the towers, the towers crumbling
to the streets, dust, screams, a
continuous
reel of destruction,
fear, as if the attacks were happening twenty-four hours
a day, every day, any time. For a while, I
couldn’t care less
about war. Then I saw corpses, of boys, who looked
just like me. This was 1982, at age ten. Ever since,
I
couldn’t care less
why anyone would want it.
In 1982, any one of those boys
could have
been me.
Now, it’s any one of those dead men could be me.
The Secretary of State offered such
counsel
to the ambassadors of the world that the United Nations
Security
Council
nodded in favor of war.
Criterion
easily becomes
criteria.
Even easier: to no longer
require either. The
data
turned out false. The doctrine
of preemption ultimately negated its need. While we
both speak English, our languages are so
different from
each other, yours might as well be Greek to me.
When the black man in the park asked, “Are you
Mexican, Puerto Rican, or are you Pakistani?”
and I said, “I’m Arab,” and he replied, “Damn.
Someone
don’t
like you very much,” I understood
perfectly what he meant. The President alluded
to the Crusades because of (not
due to
) a lack
of knowledge. Later, he retracted the statement,
worried it might offend the Middle East;
it never occurred to him the offense taken was
due to
the bombs shredding them to bits and pieces. “You are
either
with us or with the terrorists” (September 20, 2001).
“You’re
either
with us or against us” (November 6, 2001).
The day after, the disc jockey advocated, on air,
a thirty-three cent solution (the cost of a bullet)
to the problem of terrorists in our midst—he meant
in New York; also, by terrorists, I wonder did he know
he meant cab drivers, hot dog vendors, students, bankers,
neighbors, passersby, New Yorkers, Americans;
did he know he also meant Sikhs, Hindus, Iranians,
Africans, Asians; did he know, too, he meant Christians,
Jews, Buddhists, Atheists; did he realize he was
eliciting
a violent response, on the radio, in the afternoon?
Among those who did not find the remark at all
illicit:
the owners of the radio station, the FCC, the mayor,
the governor, members of the House, the Senate,
the President of the United States.
Emigrate
is better
than
immigrate.
Proof: no such thing as illegal
emigration.
Further proof: emigration is never an election issue.
I heard
enthusiastic
speeches. They hate our freedoms,
our way of life, our this, that, and the other,
and so on
(not etc). Not
everyone
agreed
every one
not “with us”
was “against us.” Detroit was
farther
from home
than my father ever imagined. He convinced himself
soon after arriving here he had ventured
further
than he should have.
Fewer
people live in his hometown
than when he left, in 1966. The number, even
less,
following thirty-four straight days of aerial bombardment.
First
(not
firstly)
my father spoke Arabic;
second
(not
secondly)
he spoke broken English;
third
(not
thirdly)
he spoke Arabic at home and English at work;
fourth
(not
fourthly)
he refused to speak English
anymore. Not every poem is
good.
Not every poem
does well. Not every poem is
well,
either. Nor does
every poem do
good.
“To grow the economy”
is more than jargon. Can a democracy
grow
without violence? Ours didn’t. They still plan to
grow
tomatoes this year, despite what was done.
Several men, civilian workers, identified as enemies,
were
hanged
on a bridge, bodies torched, corpses
swaying in the breeze. Photographs of the dead
were
hung
with care. I can
hardly
describe what is
going on. Day after day, he told
himself,
“I am
an American. I eat apple pie. I watch baseball.
I speak American English. I read American poetry.
I was born in Detroit, a city as American as it gets.
I vote. I work. I pay taxes, too many taxes. I own a car.
I make mortgage payments. I am not hungry. I worry
less than the rest of the world. I could stand to lose
a few pounds. I eat several types of cuisine
on a regular basis. I flush toilets. I let the faucet drip.
I have central air conditioning. I will never starve
to death or experience famine. I will never die
of malaria. I can say whatever the fuck I please.”
Even words succumbed;
hopefully
turned into
a kind of joke;
hopeful,
a slur.
However,
I use the words,
but less, with more care. The President
implied
compassion; but
inferred
otherwise. This is not
meant to be
ingenious.
Nor is it
ingenuous.
The more he got
into
it, the more he saw poetry,
like language, was
in
a constant state of becoming.
Regardless,
or because of this, he welcomed the misuse
of language. Language is
its
own worst enemy—
it’s
the snake devouring
its
own tail. They thought
of us not
kind of
or
sort of
but as
somewhat
American.
Lie
: “To recline or rest on a surface?” No. “To put
or place something?” No. Depleted uranium, heavy
like
lead
; its use—uranium shells—
led
to birth defects.
When in his anger the man said, “We’re going
to
teach
them a lesson,” I wonder what he thought
they would
learn.
In a war, a soldier is
less likely
to die than a civilian. He looks
like
he hates our freedoms.
You don’t know them
like
I do. He looks
as
if he hates
our freedoms. You don’t know them
as
I do.
When in his sorrow my father said, “Everybody
loose
in war,” I knew exactly what he meant. It
may be
poets should fight wars.
Maybe
then, metaphors—
not bodies, not hillsides, not hospitals, not schools—
will explode. I
might have
watched the popular sitcom
if not for my family—they were under attack,
they
might have
died. Others
may have
been laughing
at jokes while bodies were being torn apart.
I could not risk that kind of laughter. Of all the
media
covering war, which
medium
best abolishes the truth?
I deceive
myself.
I will deceive you
myself.
In the Bronx,
I
passed
as Puerto Rican. I
passed
as Greek in Queens,
also Brazilian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, even a famous,
good-looking American movie actor. As Iranian
in Manhattan. At the mall in New Jersey,
the sales clerk guessed Italian. Where Henry Ford
was born, my hometown, I always
pass
as Arab.
I may look like the men in the great paintings
of the Near East but their lives, their ways, I assure you,
are in the
past. Plus,
except in those paintings,
or at the movies, I never saw Arabs with multiple wives,
or who rode camels, lived in silk tents, drank from
desert wells;
moreover,
it’s time to move
past
that.
Did language
precede
violence? Can violence
proceed
without language? It broke my father’s heart
to talk about the
principle
of equal justice.
The news aired several
quotations
from the airline
passengers, one of whom was a middle-aged man
with children, who said, “I didn’t feel safe with them
on board.” He used the word “them” though only one,
an Arab, was on the plane. Being from Detroit,
I couldn’t help but think of Rosa Parks.
Then I got angry. I said to the TV, to no one
in particular, “If you don’t feel safe, then you
get off the goddamn plane.” You can
quote
me
on that. I was
really
angry—not
real
angry,
but
really
angry. The
reason
? A poet asked me
why I didn’t write poems about Muslim and Arab
violence against others, and I said I did. And then
he said he meant violence against Americans and Israelis,
respectively,
and I said I did, and before I could
go on he interrupted to ask why I didn’t write
poems about mothers who sent their sons and daughters
on suicide missions. As if, as if, as if. I
respectfully
decline to answer any more questions. Write your own
goddamn poem! Does this poem gratify the physical senses?
Does it use
sensuous
language? It certainly does not
attempt to gratify those senses associated with
sexual pleasure. In this way, it may not be a
sensual
poem.
However, men have been known to experience
sexual gratification in situations involving power,
especially over women, other men, life, and language.
My father said, “No matter how angry they make you,
invite the agents in the house, offer them coffee,
be polite. If they stay long, ask them to
sit.
Otherwise,
they will try to
set
you straight.” When in his
frustration he said, “
Should of,
could of, would of,”
he meant, “Stop, leave me alone, I refuse to examine
the problem further.” Because (not
since
) the terrorists
attacked us, we became more like the rest of the world
than ever before. This is
supposed
to be a poem;
it is
supposed
to be in a conversation with you.
Be
sure to
participate. “No language is more violent
than
another,” he said.
Then
he laughed, and said,
“Except the one you use.” Do conflicts of interest
exist when governments award wartime contracts
to companies
that
have close ties to government officials?
From 1995 to 2000, Dick Cheney, Vice President
of the United States, was CEO of Halliburton,
which
is headquartered in Houston, Texas,
near Bush International Airport. Would they benefit
themselves
by declaring war? Please send
those
men
back home. My grandfather lay
there
unconscious.
For days,
there
was no water, no medicine, nothing
to eat. The soldiers left
their
footprints at the doorstep.
His sons and daughters,
they’re
now grieving him.
“Try not
to
make
too
much of it” was the advice given
after
two
Homeland Security agents visited my house,
not once, not twice, but three times. I’m
waiting for
my right mind. The language is a long
ways
from here.
After the bombs fell, I called every night to find out
whether
my father was alive or dead. He always asked,
“How’s the
weather
there?” Soon enough, he assured me,
things would return to normal,
that
(not
where
)
a ceasefire was on the way.
Although
(not
while
)
I spoke English with my father, he replied in Arabic.
Then I wondered,
who’s
to decide
whose
language it is
anyway—you, me?
